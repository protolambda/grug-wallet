    The grug wallet popup goes here
    In future we should consider doing ssg with htmx to generate this
    SSG stands for server side generation it means running the golang code once
    to generate the html and then committing it
    doing ssg with the htmx allows more html/css reuse. This
    will allow us to more easily keep the look of the popup consistent with the ui
